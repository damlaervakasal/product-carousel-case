# Product Carousel and Detail Page Project

This project includes a product carousel and a product detail page, entirely built using JavaScript. The project is designed to run in the Chrome Developer Tools console and consists of a single JavaScript file. HTML and CSS structures are also dynamically created using JavaScript.

## Features

### Responsive Design
- The carousel and product detail page are designed to adapt to different screen sizes.

### Dynamic URL Management
- When a URL in the format `#product/{id}` is entered, the corresponding product's detail page is displayed.
- If an invalid URL is entered or a page other than the homepage is attempted to be opened, a **"Wrong page"** warning is shown.

### Favorite Products
- Users can add or remove products from their favorites by clicking the heart icon.
- Favorite products are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, and this information is preserved even after the page is refreshed.

### Data Management

### Single File
